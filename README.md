COMPANY : JEFFERSON RAJA A 

INTERN ID : CT04DN1133

DOMAIN : Cyber Security & Ethical Hacking 

DURATION : 4 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH

DESCRIPTION : 

This Python-based Penetration Testing Toolkit is designed for educational and ethical security testing purposes. It provides two essential penetration testing tools in a simple, command-line interface:

Port Scanner: Scans a target host for open ports (20-1024 range) to identify potential entry points
FTP Brute-Forcer: Tests FTP server credentials against a dictionary of common passwords

Features


Port Scanner Module

Scans TCP ports using socket connections
Configurable timeout settings (0.3s default)
Clearly marks open ports with visual indicators
Handles network errors gracefully

FTP Brute-Forcer Module

Implements FTP protocol login attempts
Supports custom password dictionaries (via passwords.txt)
Includes delay between attempts to avoid detection
Provides clear success/failure feedback
Handles connection errors and timeouts

Usage

The toolkit offers an intuitive menu-driven interface:
Run main.py to start the program
Select either port scanning or FTP brute-forcing
Follow the prompts to input target information
View results in clear, color-coded output

Educational Purpose


This project serves as:

A learning resource for basic penetration testing concepts
An example of Python networking capabilities
A demonstration of ethical security testing principles
Important Note: This tool should only be used on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning or brute-forcing is illegal.
